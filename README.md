# StayFit

## Description
As a web developer I spend a lot of time on the couch coding away. I'd be working for hours and was always too stubborn to take a break to refresh the mind. After realizing what was happening I decided to make a change. I created the app StayFit. StayFit gives you a body workout every half hour (or whatever time you set it to). I find that it keeps your mind awake, makes you feel good, and is great to keep your body from melting into the couch.

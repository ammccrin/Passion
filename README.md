# StayFit

## Description
As a web developer I spend a lot of time on the couch coding away. I'd be working for hours and was always too stubborn to take a break to refresh the mind. After realizing what was happening I decided to make a change. I created the app StayFit. StayFit gives you a body workout every half hour (or whatever time you set it to). It keeps your mind awake, and is great to keep your body from melting into the couch.

## Api
This app does not use any api's because I couldn't find any workout api's anywhere. However I did find that Darebee.com supplies free workouts, just not available for api. So I downloaded a bunch of workouts from there and stored them locally. In the future when I revisit this I'd like to use a webscrapper and or api's to get my workouts.

## Code
This is a rails app that uses ajax to handle it's front-end. Only thing the backend is used for is to have users, user's workouts, user's timer, and grab random workouts that I have stored locally.
